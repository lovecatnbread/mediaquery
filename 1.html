          <p>Money Heist (Spanish: La casa de papel; literally The Paper House) is a Spanish heist television series created by Álex Pina. It revolves about a long-prepared, multiple-day assault on the Royal Mint of Spain. The series was initially intended as a limited series and premiered on 2 May 2017, on Spanish network Antena 3. Antena 3 distributed the first two parts of the series in Spain, before the series was acquired by Netflix in late 2017, who edited and re-released the two parts worldwide, and will release a new, third part in 2019. Money Heist stars Úrsula Corberó, Itziar Ituño, Álvaro Morte, Paco Tous, Pedro Alonso, and Alba Flores.</p>
